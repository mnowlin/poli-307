# COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. **The College of Charleston requires that masks be worn while indoors and you must wear a mask at all times while in class.** Although vaccinations are currently not required, _I ask you to be respectful of the health and safety of others_. If you have not received the **COVID-19 vaccine (including a booster), which is safe, free, and effective, please consider doing so immediately**. Information about the vaccine is available from the [SCDHEC website](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/covid-19-vaccine) and information about where and when to obtain a vaccine is also available on the SCDHEC website [vaccine locator page](https://vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov/).  

# Course Description

From the CofC catalog: 

> This course is intended to familiarize students with various ethical frameworks, analytical tools and policy instruments that can be used to evaluate environmental problems and policy options. Specific issues may include citizen participation, environmental equity, the uses and abuses of cost/benefit analysis, science and uncertainty in environmental policy development and the use of regulatory requirements vs. market mechanisms for environmental protection.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent This course is an advanced undergraduate course.  We will examine the central dimensions of environmental politics and policy in the United States. 

<!-- Additionally, this course is a __sustainability-focused__ course associated with the college-wide focus on sustainability. For more information see here: [sustain.cofc.edu][3].  -->

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The course will provide an overview of the development of environmental policy issues and environmental politics in the US. The first part of the course will provide an introduction to environmental policy and politics in the US and will provide a theoretical base for understanding environmental policy change and development; examine the fundamental beliefs and attitudes that have shaped environmental policies; and the major political institutions in the U.S. that conceive, design, implement, and revise environmental policies. The second part of the course will examine environmental policy design including regulation and market-based approaches. Finally, we will examine several environmental issues including pollution, land management, and energy.
