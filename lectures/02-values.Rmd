# Core Values: Political Ideology

**Ideas about the role of government in society** 
* Liberal vs. Conservative

--

**Stability vs change** 

--

**Disagreement about the size, scope, and nature of government**

  * If government regulation is the _solution_ then there isn't a _problem_  

--

* **Elite driven**
  * Elected officials 
  * Energy and industry groups

# Environmental Values 

**Early environmental values: _Preservation_ and _Conservation_**
* __Preservationist__: Preserve and protect nature for its own sake

--
* __Conservation__: Prudent use of natural resources

--

**Contemporary conservation**: contains strands of traditional preservationist and conservation ideas

--

__Deep Ecology__: humans are merely a part of the larger ecosystem, which should be protected without the consideration of harm to humans

# Cultural Theory 


**Cultural theory is a core value** 

--

**Values based on cultural bias, social relations, and ways of life** 

--

* Cultural bias: _Shared values and beliefs_

--

* Social relations: _Patterns of interpersonal relations_

--

* Ways of life: _Viable combinations of social relations and cultural bias_


---

class: title title-2

# Cultural Theory 

**Ways of life (or cultural types or cultural worldviews) are captured by two cross cutting dimensions; grid and group** 

--

* **Grid**: _Degree that an individual's life is limited by externally imposed prescriptions; social regulation_

--

* **Group**: _Degree that an individual is incorporated into bounded units_ 

--

**Combining the grid and group dimensions produce four viable ways of life, or cultural types**

# Mechanisms of Cultural Cognition

--

**Cultural identity-protective cognition** 
* Policy attitudes do not threaten an individual's _identity_ 
* Values are connected to identity 

--

**Culturally biased assimilation of information** 
* Information is processed in a way that confirms values and prior beliefs 
* _The "smarter" you are the better you are at aligning information with your values_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Mechanisms of Cultural Cognition

**Cultural availability** 
* Events or information that matches beliefs more readily come to mind 

--

**Cultural credibility**
* Sources that match beliefs are more credible 

--

**Cultural-identity affirmation**
