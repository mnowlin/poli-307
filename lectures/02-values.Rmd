--

* Pertain to desirable end states or behaviors

--

* Transcend specific situations

--

* Guide selection or evaluation of behavior and events

--

* Ordered by relative importance


<!-- * Environmental policy debates are not about science as much as they are _about opposing cultural values and worldviews through which that science is seen_ -->
