???
arbitrary: based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system

capricious: given to sudden and unaccountable changes of mood or behavior

# The Rulemaking Process 

**Types of rules and rulemaking** 

--

**Formal rule**: Formal hearings that resemble a courtroom proceeding  

--

**Informal rule** (_Notice and Comment_): A quasi-legislative process that requires a public comment period

--

**Negotiated rulemaking**: Agency officials organize and participate in negotiations with stakeholders to develop a rule

--

**Hybrid**: Combines formal and informal 

---

class: title title-2

--

**Stage 1: Pre-Proposal**

# Environmental Regulations 

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/reg-goals.png" width="%"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

--

**Goal Setting** 
* Congress often sets broad goals that a law is designed to achieve
  * CWA: "swimmable" and "fishable" waters

--

* Weighed against other social and economic considerations 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/reg-goals.png" width="%"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

**Criteria determination** 

* What is "clear air?" What is "clean water?" 

--

* Requires extensive data collection and analysis

--

* **In the CAA and CWA public health was the only consideration**

# Environmental Regulations 

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/reg-goals.png" width="%"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

**Standard setting** 
* Reflects the standards that are needed for "clean air" and/or "clean water" 

--

* Determinations about the level of pollution that is acceptable for public and environmental health

--

* Performance or technology

**Enforcement of standards** 
* Facilities are monitored and inspected 

--

* Reporting requirements 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Assumptions of command-and-control regulations** 

--

* **Top-down**: Other stakeholders involved, but regulations come from government agencies 

--

* **Government knows best**: Has the information and expertise to make regulations 

--

* **One-size-fits-all**: Regulations are applied uniformly 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Assumptions of command-and-control regulations**

* **Deterrence strategy**: Facilities must comply or face consequences and absent regulation, facilities would pollute 

--

* **Little incentive to improve**: Facilities will meet the requirement, but not do any more to reduce pollution 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Command-and-control (federalism) in action** 

--

**Regulatory structure**: Rulemaking process occurs at the federal level, with implementation and enforcement delegated to the states 

--

_States collectively issue more than 90 percent of all environmental permits, complete more than 75 percent of all environmental enforcement actions, and rely on the federal government for less than 25 percent of their total funding on environmental and natural resource concerns_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Challenges of implementing command-and-control regulations** 

--

**Politics and competing priorities**  
* Environmental policy is both highly technical and highly political
* Agencies are responsive to political control 

--

**Federalism** 
* Adds complexity and coordination problems 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Challenges of implementing command-and-control regulations** 

**Resource constraints** 
* Agency capacity: budgets and personnel 
* Knowledge 

--

**Administrative structures and discretion**  
* Internal factors 
* Organizational friction 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Challenges of implementing command-and-control regulations** 

**Regulatory capture** 

_Occurs when regulators become beholden to those they attempt to regulate_ 

--

* Revolving door 

--

* Information asymmetries: companies may know more about their products than the regulators   

--

* Influence of interest groups

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

--

_Massachusetts v. EPA_ (2007)
* In a 5-4 decision the court ruled that the EPA can regulate vehicle emissions of GHGs if the EPA determines that GHGs "endanger public health or welfare"

--

**EPA Endangerment finding** (2009)

* _Greenhouse gas emissions endanger both the public health and public welfare of current and future generations_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

**Clean Power Plan** (Obama Administration) 

--

* Set of _goal_ of GHG emission reductions of 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030

--


* _Performance standard_: 
 * Set limit on amount of GHGs that states can emit
 * Allowed states to come up with how they could meet the standard
 * If states didn't develop a plan, than the EPA would 

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

**Clean Power Plan** (Obama Administration) 

* To develop standards EPA examined whether states could: 
  * Run coal plants more efficiently 
  * Replace coal with natural gas 
  * Increase renewable energy sources 

--

* **Supreme Court issued a stay in February 2016 and the CPP was never implemented** 


---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

**Affordable Clean Energy Rule** (Trump Administration)

--

* Estimated to cut emissions by 0.7 to 1.5 percent of 2005 levels by 2030 

--

* No state-based requirement, only facility requirements

--

* Efficiency standard that meant coal plants could be used more  

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

**Affordable Clean Energy Rule** (Trump Administration)

* EPA's impact assessment: _the proposed rule is expected to increase emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and increase the level of emissions of certain pollutants in the atmosphere that adversely affect human health_

---

class: title title-2

# Environmental Regulations 

**Regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act** 

**Affordable Clean Energy Rule** (Trump Administration)

* **Vacated by the DC District court in January 2021** 

_Because promulgation of the ACE Rule and its embedded repeal of the Clean Power Plan rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act, we vacate the ACE Rule and remand to the [Environmental Protection] Agency_
