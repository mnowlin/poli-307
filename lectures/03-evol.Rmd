# Conservation Era: 1890-1962

.pull-left[.small[
_Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources, whether of wood, water, or grass, from contributing their full share to the welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, gives the assurance of larger and more certain supplies. The fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use. Forest protection is not an end of itself; it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend on them_

Future generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for the integrity of the natural world that supports all life_
