# Unofficial Actors 

**Unofficial actors**: individuals and organizations that try to influence the actions of official actors (Congress, the president, the bureaucracy, and the courts) and the outcomes of elections 

--

**Outside government**: unofficial actors do _not_ have constitutionally or legally created incentives or mandates to be a part of the environmental policymaking process 

--

**But**, they are still an important factor in environmental policymaking


---

class: title title-2

# Policy Subsystems 

**Substantive issue alliances that cross institutional boundaries and include both governmental [official] and nongovernmental [unofficial] actors** 

--

* Subsystems are organized around a __policy domain__ 

--

**Policy domain**: Substantive area of policy over which participants in policy making compete and compromise (e.g., air pollution, land management)

# Political Parties 

**Polarization**: Divergent views along ideological and/or partisan lines

--

**Republican**: _Republican ideology argues for individual liberty as opposed to government interference. Its preference for small government coincides with a pro-business, free-market attitude and thus an aversion to government control_ 

--

**Democratic**: _Democratic ideology is more commonly associated with liberalism and an acceptance of government involvement in the political, economic, and social lives of people_

# Interest Group Influence 

"It’s not only about the money, having money helps, but the other side will always have more and they don’t always win"

.small[-Wesley Warren, _Natural Resources Defense Council_]

--

* On salient and contentious issues both sides tend to be well-resourced 

--

* Interest groups tend to support their friends and allies  

--

* But, business interests have an advantage when issues aren't salient and they can be active in each stage of the process

# Public Opinion 

**The Paradox of Public Opinion on the Environment** 

In general, support for addressing environmental problems is high among the public, **but** other issues (the economy, healthcare) tend to be more important 

--

* Other issues crowd out the agenda, even as the public supports action on environmental issues 


---

class: title title-2 

# Public Opinion 


**Polarization** 

Following elite and party cues, the public is polarized over environmental issues. Particularly those that are most engaged  

--

**Thermostatic** 

Like a thermostat, public support for environmental policy increases (decreases) as government action on the environment decreases (increases)
