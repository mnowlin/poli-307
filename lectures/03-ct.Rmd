# Cultural Theory 

**Ways of life (or cultural types or cultural worldviews) are captured by two cross cutting dimensions; grid and group** 

--

* **Grid**: _Degree that an individual's life is limited by externally imposed prescriptions; social regulation_

--

* **Group**: _Degree that an individual is incorporated into bounded units_ 

--

**Combining the grid and group dimensions produce four viable ways of life, or cultural types**

**Values and beliefs guide how people _think_ about policy issues** 

Environmental policy debates are not about science as much as they are _about opposing cultural values and worldviews through which that science is seen_
